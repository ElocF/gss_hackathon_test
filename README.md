Monster Horror book, with four chapters about a GIS person saving the world with cartography

# Chapter 1: Data Doesn’t Lie
Jordan Vega, a reclusive GIS analyst working for a quiet government contractor, spent most days immersed in topographic data and satellite imagery—until he stumbled across a bizarre anomaly: a set of identical landforms appearing in separate regions across the country, each one a perfect geometric match, yet separated by thousands of miles. At first, he suspected a projection error or corrupted shapefile, but the timestamps were current, and the anomalies kept spreading. Digging deeper, Jordan discovered the same shape repeating in archived maps going back decades—always hidden just beneath cloud cover, in areas marked as data-incomplete or "inconclusive terrain." When he tried to escalate his findings, entire layers of data vanished, access was denied, and a co-worker dismissed his concerns with a chilling offhand comment: “That place doesn’t exist anymore.” Obsessively overlaying historic and modern maps, Jordan saw the true shape revealed—a monstrous, growing pattern stitched across the landscape like a buried organism. As the last layers aligned, his screen flickered and the terrain pulsed, subtly but unmistakably—like something deep beneath the Earth had just taken a breath.

# Chapter 2: Contours of the Unknow

Jordan Vega’s obsession deepens as he overlays the shifting anomalies across historic and live GIS data, uncovering a growing network of identical landforms spreading like roots beneath the earth. Each site is a dead zone—where drones crash, signals vanish, and surveyors go missing—officially dismissed as coincidence or hardware failure. Sealing himself in his office, Jordan builds a wall of maps, tracing the monstrous shape forming beneath the surface, its outline disturbingly organic. Then, as he models elevation changes in 3D, the impossible happens: the terrain begins to move in real-time—slowly rising and falling—revealing a pulse in the landscape. The maps aren’t just showing something alive. They’re listening to it.

# Chapter 3: The Choropleth of Dread
Elara's research leads her to a horrifying conclusion. The lines are a kind of monstrous, biological cartography, drawn by an unseen entity to mark territory and convert it into a suitable environment for its arrival. The hum isn't just a sound; it's a resonant frequency meant to break down organic matter and rewrite the landscape. She creates a choropleth map  that color-codes the intensity of the hum and the density of the black moss. This map reveals a central point of origin: a seemingly unremarkable cave system in a remote mountain range. She realizes the entity isn't an alien invading from space, but something ancient and terrestrial, awakened by human overdevelopment. Its goal is to terraform the planet, and the "cracks" are its first steps.
