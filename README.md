# This is a exercise to practice one method of development using git (Feature Branch workflow)

1. clone
2. branch
3. edits (add)
4. commit
5. Pull Request merge

## Will and Cole Setup 
- [ ] Create repo
- [ ] create readme with instructions and chapter index
- [ ] create chapters chapter1.md, chapter2.md, chapter3.md, chapter4.md
- [ ] add users to the repo as contributors
- [ ] lock main branch to allow changes by pull request only.

## The Demo -- Reveal the AI prompt
- [ ] create branch to add the chapter or book prompt
- [ ] switch to branch
- [ ] make changes, commit
- [ ] push changes
- [ ] pull request - merge prompt to main

## The Beginning -- User instructions
- [ ] ``` git clone ```
- [ ] ``` git pull ```

## The User -- Instructions
- [ ] create branch new feature --- your chapter and paragraph -- TODO: ADD Instructions
- [ ] write your chapters paragraph, add images etc. After changes use regular commits eg. "add chapter 3 intro photo", 
	IMPORTANT --- use the prompts provided to keep the content of the book aligned
- [ ] ensure you have committed all your changes, make the final push

##  The Final Boss -- Pull requests
- [ ] Make a pull request to merge your content into the main book. 
- [ ] switch to main branch
- [] ``` git pull ``` to see the book

Monster Horror book, with four chapters about a GIS person saving the world with cartography

# Chapter 2: Contours of the Unknow

Jordan Vega’s obsession deepens as he overlays the shifting anomalies across historic and live GIS data, uncovering a growing network of identical landforms spreading like roots beneath the earth. Each site is a dead zone—where drones crash, signals vanish, and surveyors go missing—officially dismissed as coincidence or hardware failure. Sealing himself in his office, Jordan builds a wall of maps, tracing the monstrous shape forming beneath the surface, its outline disturbingly organic. Then, as he models elevation changes in 3D, the impossible happens: the terrain begins to move in real-time—slowly rising and falling—revealing a pulse in the landscape. The maps aren’t just showing something alive. They’re listening to it.

# Chapter 3: The Choropleth of Dread
Elara's research leads her to a horrifying conclusion. The lines are a kind of monstrous, biological cartography, drawn by an unseen entity to mark territory and convert it into a suitable environment for its arrival. The hum isn't just a sound; it's a resonant frequency meant to break down organic matter and rewrite the landscape. She creates a choropleth map  that color-codes the intensity of the hum and the density of the black moss. This map reveals a central point of origin: a seemingly unremarkable cave system in a remote mountain range. She realizes the entity isn't an alien invading from space, but something ancient and terrestrial, awakened by human overdevelopment. Its goal is to terraform the planet, and the "cracks" are its first steps.
