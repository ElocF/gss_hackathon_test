# This is a exercise to practice one method of development using git (Feature Branch workflow)

1. clone
2. branch
3. edits (add)
4. commit
5. Pull Request merge

## Will and Cole Setup 
- [ ] Create repo
- [ ] create readme with instructions and chapter index
- [ ] create chapters chapter1.md, chapter2.md, chapter3.md, chapter4.md
- [ ] add users to the repo as contributors
- [ ] lock main branch to allow changes by pull request only.

## The Demo -- Reveal the AI prompt
- [ ] create branch to add the chapter or book prompt

- [ ] make changes, commit
- [ ] push changes
- [ ] pull request - merge prompt to main

## The Beginning -- User instructions
