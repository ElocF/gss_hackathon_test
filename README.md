Monster Horror book, with four chapters about a GIS person saving the world with cartography


# Chapter 1: "Data Doesn’t Lie"
## Genre: Monster Horror / Geospatial Thriller
## Tone: Paranoia, isolation, creeping dread

### Paragraph 1 – The Quiet Analyst

Prompt: Introduce the GIS protagonist (name, setting, and mindset). They work alone or in a small team, possibly for a government agency or contractor. Describe a normal workday until they notice an anomaly in the data — a cluster of identical anomalies showing up in unrelated locations.

Example guidance: Focus on how the data first caught their attention — was it elevation data? Satellite imagery? Maybe a terrain shadow that doesn't make sense? Maybe a landform that keeps changing shape between datasets?

### Paragraph 2 – The Impossible Cluster

Prompt: The anomalies are in wildly different locations — hundreds or even thousands of miles apart — but the same geometric footprint appears. The polygon outlines are identical, like someone copy-pasted a land scar across the country. But the timestamps are recent, and they keep spreading.

Example guidance: Emphasize the fear of patterns. Have the character double-check projections, metadata, satellite versions. Make them start to realize this isn't a glitch. “Different states. Same mark. Same day.”


### Paragraph 3 – Suppressed Data

Prompt: When they try to bring the anomaly to a supervisor or submit a report, the data gets overwritten or redacted. Someone — or something — is scrubbing these files. The protagonist dives deeper, cross-referencing historical topographic maps, archived aerial imagery, and finds that the pattern has existed for years, maybe centuries, but only shows up in cartography… not in person.

Example guidance: Build a sense of paranoia. The computer system slows down. Access is denied. A shapefile is missing. A co-worker casually tells them, “That area doesn’t exist anymore.”

### Paragraph 4 – The Breathing Map

Prompt: The protagonist stays late at the office, determined to get answers. As they overlay all the patterns — modern and historic — the shapes begin to form something monstrous when viewed at full scale. Just as they realize this, the map glitches — and something moves. A ripple across the topography. Something beneath.

Example guidance: End on a visceral image. Something terrible is buried — and the map is the only thing that can see it. And it's starting to look back.
